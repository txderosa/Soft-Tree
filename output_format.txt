For each graph:
    - The top line is of the form: <V> <E>
      where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges
      in the graph.

    - For each algorithm:
       	  * The top line is of the form: <A>: <T>
	    where A is the name of the algorithm, and T is the time
	    the algorithm took to find a MST of the graph.

	  * Subsequent lines are of the format: <v1> <v2> <w>
	    where v1, v2 are the IDs of a vertex, and w is the weight
	    of the edge between v1 and v2.

	  * NOTE: edges are ordered by the first vertex, then by the
	    second
	    i.e. If there are edges: (1,4) (2,3) (1,2) (2,1) (1,5).
	    	 Then edges with the first vertex as 1 will appear
		 before edges with the first vertex as 2. Within
		 the group of edges with the same first vertex,
		 edges are ordered by the second vertex.
		 The edges above would appear as follows:
		 1 2
		 1 4
		 1 5
		 2 1
		 2 3
      		 Weight of edges not shown.
