The first line of a file is of the form: <G>
where G is the number of graphs inside the file.

For each graph:
    - The first line is of the form: <V> <E>
      where V is the number of vertices, and E is the number of edges 
      in the graph.

    - Subsequent lines are of the format: <v1> <v2> <w>
      where v1, v2 are the IDs of a vertex, and w is the weight of the
      edge between v1 and v2.
      
    - NOTE: edges are ordered by the first vertex, then by the second
      i.e. If there are edges: (0,3) (1,2) (0,1) (1,0) (0,4).
      	   Then edges with the first vertex as 1 will appear before
	   edges with the first vertex as 2. Within the group of edges 
	   with the same first vertex, edges are ordered by the second
	   vertex.
	   The edges above would appear as follows:
	   0 1
	   0 3
	   0 4
	   1 0
	   1 2
	   Weight of edges not shown.

NOTE: for our project, we will assume that all files are correctly formatted.
